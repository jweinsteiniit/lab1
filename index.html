  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <h1>A little bit about myself:</h1>
  <p>My name is Jake Weinstein, and I'm currently a high school senior at Jones College Prep. I'm taking this class as part of a duel enrollment program. In college, wherever I go, I plan to do either
  a joint or double major in Applied Math and Computer Science. I'm interested in both fields, and I'm especially interested in where they intersect; how
  some hard math problems are best solved with assistance from computers. I've never done any web development or HTML at all, but I think I'll catch on quickly.
  I'm looking forward to the rest of this course.</p>
